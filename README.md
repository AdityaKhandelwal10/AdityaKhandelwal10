<h2>Hi there ðŸ‘‹. I am Aditya Khandelwal.</h2> 
I love tinkering and building stuff with new technologies. 
I use Java and Python as my primary languages. 
I focus on backend development but have experimented with Machine Learning, App Development and Frontend in the past. 

I have experience in Django, Flask and SpringBoot. I have also worked with Redis, Celery and databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL.

I love solving complex problems with the help of technology. Currently, I am working on my Data Structures and Algorithms skills to make me a better programmer!
